            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no duty incident to the Place I have the Honour to serve the KING in, to which I come with lesse willingnesse, or confidence, than to this of speaking to such an <hi>Assembly:</hi> And by that time I have done, you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have reason to be unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the necessity imposed by custom upon all that sit in this Place, to make speeches; a <hi>Custom</hi> perhaps reasonably
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63422:3"/>introduced by those that did, or at least thought they did it well; but somewhat hardly continued upon those that were sure they did it ill. And yet though I am in the <hi>Number of the Last,</hi> I will rather obey the <hi>Necessity,</hi> than hazard the Imputation of <hi>Sullenesse</hi> or <hi>Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Besides, I do not know, but that to be silent at this time, and in this Place, may be a <hi>greater Fault</hi> than any I hope I shall commit in speaking; for we are taught by <hi>Infallible Authority,</hi> and enjoyned by <hi>Indispensable Precept,</hi> and it seemes to be agreeable to the Dictates of <hi>NATƲRE</hi> and <hi>REASON,</hi> as well as of <hi>RELIGION</hi> and <hi>PIETY,</hi> that for all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings we recieve from the <hi>Divine MAJESTY,</hi> we should make as proportionable Returns as he within our Power: And therefore <hi>Publique</hi> and <hi>National BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SINGS,</hi> doe require <hi>Publique</hi> and <hi>Solemne CELEBRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS.</hi> This was it that induced the Transmission of that Act for an <hi>Anniversary Thanksgiving for his Majesties most Happy RESTITƲTION;</hi> and this is it, which if it be duely, that is, sincerely performed, is most like to perpetuate to us, and to our POSTERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, all the <hi>Happinesses</hi> consequent to that <hi>BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SING.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What these <hi>Happinesses</hi> are, or at least may be, if we Our selves obstruct not the course of them would be best discerned, and set off, by a <hi>RETROSPECT</hi> into the state of things for above twenty years past; and by opposing to that <hi>Dismal Object</hi> of Our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the <hi>Cheerfulnesse</hi> and <hi>Serenty</hi> of the <hi>Prospect</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Desolations</hi> of those yeares could be ennumerated in the time I mean to allow this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; or if they could be discribed to the Life, by so ill an Orator as I am, they would be fewer, and more supportable, then <hi>I</hi> doubt the sad experience of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have found them to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> shall therefore onely put you in mind of some more <hi>Remarkable</hi> and <hi>Fundamentall deliverances</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi> wrought by most <hi>wonderfull Providence,</hi> as a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63422:3"/>thankful acknowledgment fit, as I conceive, to be the subject of the first discourse from this place, where I have the honour, how unworthily, and how unresem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly soever, to represent the Majestie of my <hi>Great Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This very <hi>Seat of Royalty</hi> is delivered from some neglected corner, or contemptible use, or from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation worse than either, from the Usurpation of mean and low Aspirers, who having no shadow of right to it, had no other way to ascend it, than by treading down and destroying whatever was ordained by God or man, to fence and guard it; their extravagant Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion transporting them, and darkning their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to that degree, as not to consider how short their possession of that Throne must be, to the disarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and violation of which, they themselves had but newly shewn the way.</p>
            <p>We see this Throne now restored to its proper place, and Natural use, surrounded and supported by <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> by <hi>Officers, Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> the Out-works, as well as Ornaments of Majestie.</p>
            <p>We see it restored to the approach, and I doubt not to the delight of the meanest of the Commons, whom you Gentlemen do, nor ought not disdain to represent; for they are the <hi>Foundation</hi> upon which <hi>Monarchy</hi> is built, the <hi>strength</hi> wherewith it is guarded, and the <hi>wealth</hi> whereby it is sustained, inriched and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</p>
            <p>It is restored to the <hi>undoubted Lawful Possessour,</hi> the <hi>Off-spring</hi> of a long continued <hi>Race of Princes;</hi> in whom all the <hi>Contested Titles</hi> of former Ages are met, without the pretence of a <hi>Competitor,</hi> and in whom all the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> of those Ages are united, without the severity (to say no worse) of some of the Great and Warlike; &amp; without the as harmful weaknesses of others of more devout and peaceable dispositions: A PRINCE
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63422:4"/>that hath given frequent proof, that though he loves and seeks peace for his Subjects sakes, he fears not War for his own.</p>
            <p>This Sword, the Instrument of conferring Military Honour, and the Emblem of inflicting Punishment, is delivered from the ridiculous Stage-like Pageantry of later times, and from a more execrable and Tragical Abuse, from cutting off the most Innocent, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most guilty.</p>
            <p>We see it now by the visible immediate hand of God restored, and put into that <hi>Hand</hi> that only had <hi>His Commission</hi> to bear and use it; and let it be <hi>Our Prayer,</hi> That he bear it long; and that he may bear it long, that he bear it not in vain, but to the <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>exterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Evil-doers,</hi> and to the <hi>support</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of those that do well.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> himself, whose <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> these are, is accountable to God, and we to God for him, for many and <hi>great deliverances:</hi> He is delivered from the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of his <hi>Father,</hi> and the Usurpers of his <hi>Inheritance;</hi> from their restless endeavours to destroy his Person, and to blast his Fame; from their open violence, and secret contrivements against both; from Exile, and all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting consequences of that miserable state of a King; from comfortless wandrings for Protection; from cold Receptions; from narrow supports; &amp; from such appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for them, as were more unsupportable, than the want of them could be to him that was born, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to give, rather then receive them. He is delivered from a continual tormenting Anxietie for the danger of his Friends, and the oppression and slavery of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; from the importunity of impertinent Arguments, drawn from his misfortunes, to draw him from his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and from a necessity of hearing, and bearing with the Reproaches and Revilings cast upon our then De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Church, only because she was desolate, and made so by her own <hi>unnatural Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63422:4"/>
            <p> From this dejected, despised, and in all humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, desperate condition, he is raised and restored to the Throne of his Fathers, to his Native Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more dear and valuable to him, by his experience of others; to the free and uncontrol'd exercise of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he was bred in, to a capacity of making Royal Retribution for any kindness he hath received abroad or from home: and which is the greatest earthly Felicity, so good a KING as he could wish, he is not onely resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, but by the love of his People, without the chargeable, and many times dangerous assistance of Strangers, who are not over-tender, nor much distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing betwixt the party they come to assist, and that they come to subdue, when they are made Umpires in such Quarrels; for they rarely employ their Auxiliary Treasure and blood, purely out of Generosity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; which may in Romance be found the ultimate end of such Assistance, but seldom in the truth of <hi>History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may be observed, that if the revolt and devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Nations from their KING, and from <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> it self, was the most unreasonable and prodigious that any age hath known, their voluntary uncompelled Return to both, is as much without example: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could the Return have been so miraculous, if the Revolt had not been so prodigious. And it may also be worth the observing, that as the first most bloody Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from Peace to Rebellion, took birth in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, so from hence came the first Overtures to Peace and Submission.</p>
            <p>By and with the Kings deliverance and Restitution, our Church is delivered from Contempt, Sacriledge and Desolation, and restored to a due veneration, a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent improving support, and to fair beginnings of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and Order.</p>
            <p>Our Laws are delivered from corrupt, incompetent Interpreters, from monstrous, unnatural expositions and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63422:5"/>applications, and Justice is restored to the distribution of upright, learned, lawfully sworn and authorized Judges.</p>
            <p>The noblest acts of <hi>Loyaltie</hi> shall now no more receive the judgment due to the fowlest Treason, due to the unrighteous Judges, that pronounced it without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Persons, or Justice in the Sentence. High Courts of Justice shall no more usurp that name, nor our Benches be crouded or oppressed with the throng and wicked weight of those that ought rather to have stood manacled at the Bar. A happy change to those for whose destruction those extravagant Tribunals were erected, and a secure change to all; for it hath been often an observed method in Gods never-failing Justice, to catch <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi> in those very snares they had prepared for others.</p>
            <p>All men are delivered from the intanglements of two-edged Oaths; from the conflicts raised by them in mens brests, betwixt Conscience and conveniencie, betwixt the prostitution of Conscience, and the ruine of their Fortunes; than which a harder, a more <hi>Tyrannical choice</hi> cannot be obtruded upon Christians: For here the <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was not, <hi>Swear thus against your Conscience, or you shall have no part in the Civil Government, no Office in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, no Benefice in the Church;</hi> but, <hi>Swear thus, or you shall have no house to put your head in, no bread to sustain your selves, your wives and children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude these Observations, Who is not delivered from some <hi>Oppression,</hi> and restored to some <hi>Advantage?</hi> Even those that shall lose <hi>the wages of iniquity,</hi> their ill-got possessions, shall be delivered from the <hi>oppression of a bad;</hi> and if they have any, shall be <hi>restored to a good Conscience;</hi> if they have none, they were not in the <hi>Kings,</hi> and I hope will not be in <hi>Your</hi> care.</p>
            <p>Those that shall be kept out of their ancient Estates, the <hi>Inheritance of their Fathers,</hi> through defect of their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63422:5"/>
               <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and by the All-disposing <hi>Providence of God,</hi> who was not pleased to make them active Instruments in this <hi>Happy Change,</hi> are delivered from Tyrannous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements, causeless Imprisonments, and a continual fear of their lives: The good Land lies afore them, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry is at Liberty, and they are restored to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Subjects, and protection of the Laws: If an <hi>Irish Papist</hi> be opprest, they shall relieve him; if the blood of the meanest of them be shed, it shall be strictly enquired after: Let this state be compared with that they were in before the <hi>Kings Restitution,</hi> and it will be found the greatest looser has got something by it.</p>
            <p>As it is <hi>our duty</hi> thus thankfully to <hi>commemorate</hi> these <hi>great things</hi> done for us; so it is <hi>our duty</hi> to <hi>endevour</hi> in our several <hi>Stations,</hi> to <hi>improve</hi> and <hi>secure</hi> them to <hi>Our selves,</hi> and <hi>Our Posterity:</hi> And sure the most <hi>Natural way</hi> to that end, is to call to mind, and avoid <hi>those Errours</hi> that <hi>brought</hi> us into those <hi>miseries</hi> from which we are <hi>redeemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the <hi>causes too boldly assigned,</hi> for the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties these <hi>Nations</hi> so long laboured under: But in such <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions</hi> the <hi>verdict</hi> is seldom impartially brought in, the <hi>Jury</hi> are too often <hi>the Criminals:</hi> But I think I may safely say, that <hi>one,</hi> and that a <hi>fundamental cause,</hi> was, that the <hi>late King</hi> was <hi>maliciously represented</hi> to the People; I am sure the <hi>Freedom, Peace, Plenty,</hi> and <hi>Happinesses</hi> they were told they should <hi>enjoy without him,</hi> proved miserable and fatal <hi>delusions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us mistrust those that shall use the same Arts, lest they involve us in the same miserie; and let us judge of the <hi>Kings intentions</hi> to His People, by His <hi>Publique Acts</hi> of grace and bounty; by His mild and easie Government; by Hiedesire and endevours to make His Subjects happy at home; and renowned abroad; and by the reluctancy of His Nature to just severity, when the wickedness or frenzy of the worst Offenders extort it from him.</p>
            <p>That something will be amiss in the Administration of the most perfect Government in this world, must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63422:6"/>but whoever shall think that these things are to be <hi>rectified by force upon the Government,</hi> and that effected, proposes to acquiesce, and return to <hi>Obedience,</hi> cannot <hi>know himself</hi> so well, as to be sure, that <hi>Opportunity</hi> and <hi>success</hi> may not suggest more <hi>inordinate Appetites</hi> to him; And there are those alive that know, how far further than their <hi>first intention,</hi> the <hi>Reformers</hi> of our times were led on, til the unwarrantable force they had raised, grew <hi>too strong</hi> for their <hi>Management,</hi> flew in their faces, and in conclusion, <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those villanies,</hi> that I dare say their <hi>Souls abhorred;</hi> but neither their <hi>Policy</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> could restrain.</p>
            <p>We have had <hi>sad experience,</hi> and let us be the wiser for it, in how <hi>short a time,</hi> a how <hi>few days,</hi> the <hi>industry</hi> of <hi>many years,</hi> nay, of <hi>an Age,</hi> may be destroyed and laid wast, when <hi>Rage and Rapine</hi> are let loose. If once <hi>Sedition</hi> grow too strong for the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> for the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi> so that the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>silenced,</hi> or the language of it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or inverted, and the <hi>Magistrate</hi> removed as <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome</hi> and <hi>unnecessary,</hi> let us remember what variety of <hi>misery</hi> and <hi>mischief</hi> is brought upon <hi>the people;</hi> how unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable their <hi>sufferings</hi> are, and how Intolerable their <hi>fears of suffering</hi> they know not what more, by whom, or how long. Let the people remember how <hi>many,</hi> and how <hi>chargeable</hi> their <hi>Masters,</hi> nay how <hi>many</hi> and <hi>chargeable</hi> the <hi>changes</hi> of their <hi>Masters</hi> were, when once they foolishly <hi>affected the misery,</hi> indeed the <hi>impossibility of having none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Misrepresentations</hi> had taken <hi>place</hi> and <hi>root</hi> in the minds of the people, their hearts grew <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>barren,</hi> towards the <hi>King;</hi> those that soon after rob'd them both, perswading them to keep their <hi>purses full for them to empty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This close <hi>Oratory</hi> is seldome <hi>unsuccessful;</hi> but what the people got by following this <hi>thrifty counsel,</hi> some have taken the pains to compute, and it is found, that the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> laid and levyed upon the people, to support <hi>Ʋsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> in a few <hi>bad years</hi> came to more, than the most chargeable <hi>Princes</hi> had raised in some Ages to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Enemies</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> abroad, whilest this was <hi>employed</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63422:6"/>to make <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> and little better than <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> at home.</p>
            <p>I confess this <hi>Animadversion</hi> is not so seasonable now, or proper to be <hi>applied</hi> to you, who in your <hi>Liberalities,</hi> have outgone all <hi>Example,</hi> and prevented <hi>even the Kings wishes;</hi> nor are those <hi>Liberalities</hi> the <hi>less,</hi> but the <hi>more</hi> valued by Him, that he intends to <hi>apply them</hi> intirely to the security and improvement of a <hi>true Protestant,</hi> and a <hi>right English Interest</hi> in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that declares, indeed that constitutes perfect union, and a <hi>happy Harmony,</hi> so much as <hi>mutual trusts</hi> and <hi>confidences,</hi> and the interchange of <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;</hi> it is so in private <hi>Friendship,</hi> and it is much more so, in that good <hi>Intelligence</hi> which must make a <hi>King and His people happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> has trusted you as far as ever <hi>King</hi> trusted Subjects; and He has given you more than ever any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lord of Ireland</hi> had to give.</p>
            <p>You have trusted <hi>the King with all you had,</hi> and all <hi>you</hi> had to pretend to; and you have given <hi>Him more</hi> than he thought of to desire; Let it not therefore <hi>be apprehended,</hi> that this <hi>Commerce</hi> must cease by the <hi>Prodigality</hi> on both sides, as if there were no more to be <hi>given</hi> or <hi>received:</hi> No, my <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> protection from <hi>Forreign Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> at home, the due and uncorrupt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of <hi>Government,</hi> and of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and under them the <hi>advancement</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Learning, Trade,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Improvements,</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that may to the <hi>end of time,</hi> descend from the Throne to you and yours: And a due subjection to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and obedience to those Laws, and application to that Piety and Learning to that Trade and Industry, and to those Improvements, may be as lasting Retributions from the People to the Throne.</p>
            <p>I should here end this unusual Exercise, but that I am commanded by the <hi>King</hi> to let you know, that as He is abundantly satisfied with those demonstrations of <hi>Duty, Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> you have given him, during the whole
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63422:7"/>time of your sitting, so he looks with great <hi>Pleasure</hi> &amp; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> upon those <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> that have past from him to you; and he commands me to be sure not to forget to assure you, upon all Proper Occasions; that all his <hi>Promises</hi> shall be <hi>inviolably observed;</hi> and that he will <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to whatever else may make this <hi>Kingdome flourishing</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> whether it shall be the Enacting of <hi>new</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> or the <hi>repeal</hi> of <hi>old, unuseful,</hi> or <hi>burthensome Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say <hi>any thing</hi> of, or from <hi>my Self</hi> in this place, may be <hi>Presumption;</hi> but to say nothing to <hi>you, my Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> to whom I owe so much, must be <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> You have before and since <hi>My Arrival,</hi> been pleased to make <hi>many</hi> and <hi>obliging Expressions</hi> of <hi>your Approbation</hi> of the <hi>Kings choice</hi> of Me for this Government: I have great reason to fear, both the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>you</hi> consulted <hi>your Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> to Me, more than <hi>your judgement</hi> of Me.</p>
            <p>Yet without much <hi>presumption</hi> or <hi>vanity,</hi> I think I may say, thus far the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>you</hi> may be excusable, that He chose, and You approved a <hi>Person,</hi> whose Fortune and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily must prosper or decay, must ruine or subsist by and with this Kingdom. This has not perhaps always been the case, and it is possible mean <hi>Abilities</hi> thus stimulated, may be more <hi>profitable industrious</hi> than greater, actuated by less, or by <hi>contrary Incentives.</hi> There are upon me all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable <hi>Obligations</hi> to apply all that is in me, to the <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> of this Kingdom: Those of <hi>duty, fidelity</hi> and <hi>thankefulness</hi> to the best, and most bountiful <hi>Master</hi> in the world; those of <hi>Retribution</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to you, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and liberal manifestations of <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and those of self-preservation and happiness: Hence it may be concluded reasonably and naturally, that my endevours will be hearty and faithful; and my failings, which shall be as few as I can, unvoluntary, and therefore the more pardonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You will presently, when I am retired, be at liberty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ your selves to the time you desired.</hi>
